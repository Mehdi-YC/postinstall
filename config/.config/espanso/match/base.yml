# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":ca"
    replace: "#YAHIA CHERIF Mohamed Mahdi add {{today}}\n#End YAHIA CHERIF Mohamed Mahdi {{today}}"
    vars:
      - name: today
        type: date
        params: 
          format: "%d/%m/%Y"
        
  - trigger: ":ce"
    replace: "#YAHIA CHERIF Mohamed Mahdi Edit {{today}}\n#End YAHIA CHERIF Mohamed Mahdi {{today}}"
    vars:
      - name: today
        type: date
        params: 
          format: "%m/%d/%Y" 
        
    # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:
 
  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print league of legends
  - trigger: ":ro"
    replace: "Record.objects.get(id=record).space"
  # Print league of legends
  - trigger: ":lol"
    replace: "League of legends"
  # Print league of legends
  - trigger: ":tft"
    replace: "Team fight tactics"

  - trigger: ":ss"
    replace:  "{\n
    \"En cours\":\"badge badge-light-info rounded-pill\", \n
    \"Termin√©\":\"badge badge-light-success rounded-pill\"\n
      }"
